# Weather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Dev notes

It is a simple app that will display 5 pre-defined cities in angular material cards, clicking on any of them will trigger a forecast search that will display the min and max temperature for the next hours in that specific country.

The app circles arround Angular last version (8 at this moment), Angular Material, and the more scalable styling conventions like ITCSS for the folder structure and BEM class naming.

To launch it, download the code, perform a `npm install` and after that `ng serve`, sit back and let the magic flow.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
