          \n\nWeather\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.1.1.\nDev notes\nIt is a simple app that will display 5 pre-defined cities in angular material cards, clicking on any of them will trigger a forecast search that will display the min and max temperature for the next hours in that specific country.\nThe app circles arround Angular last version (8 at this moment), Angular Material, and the more scalable styling conventions like ITCSS for the folder structure and BEM class naming.\nTo launch it, download the code, perform a npm install and after that ng serve, sit back and let the magic flow.\nDocumentation\nDocumentation is already part of the repo, and can be viewed inside the documentation folder and opening the index.html file,\nbut it can be updated (or viewed real time) simply by executing npm run compodoc and accessing the served url http://127.0.0.1:8080\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nTest coverage\nRun ng test --code-coverage to see current coverage, a new coverage folder will also be created for a more interactive experience\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
